TO build the Logical Part of a Website we use JavaScript.

Primitive Types in JavaScript
-Numbers
-Strings
-Boolean
-Null
-Undefined

Numbers
--In JavaScript Has only one Number Type unclude
Positive,Negative ,whole numbers or Decimal Numbers.

Math Operator built in JavaScript
add,sub,mul,div and modulo

Follows The Rule PEMDAS rule except BODMAS Rule in math operators


NaN : Not a Number.
0/0 //NaN
1 + NaN  //NaN

typeof() : tells the type of element that is passed.

** is exponent expression.
3**2 == 3^2

----Varaiables :
Basic Syntex =>   let someName = Value;
e.g let year = 1985;

 += ,-= ,*= ,/= works
 increment++ , decrement--     also works.


 ---Const & var :
 Const Keyword --> caonst work just like let,except you change the Value.
 var --> Old way to make Variables in JavaScript and it still works.

 --Booleans 
True or False are the only values are There.
eg. let abc = True;
Since Boolean is a Varible so it can be changed from true/ false to
numbers.(Exception)

Variables Naming Convensions:
-we can not have spaces in some in Name.
-we cannot start name with digit.
-can contain '$','_'.

CamelCase : 
abc_efg-->snake case
abcDeg -->CamelCase,can start with capital letter.
